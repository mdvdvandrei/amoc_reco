# AMOC Reconstruction with Machine Learning

This repository contains code and experiments for reconstructing the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)** from surface climate variables using machine learning methods.

## Features
- Data preprocessing from CMIP6 climate models outputs (NetCDF, Zarr, xarray).
- Machine learning framework for AMOC index reconstruction.
- Evaluation pipeline with cross-validation and ensemble metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch
- xarray, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- NetCDF4, Zarr
- Hydra (for experiment configs)
